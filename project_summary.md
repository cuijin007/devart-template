## Description
Traget User: Long-Distances' lovers
Discription: For LDR peoples, the distances is always the biggest problem. For them they communicate by words, audios and cybercams to feel the existances of the relationship. However, all those ways are only on the niveau of 'thought', they couldn't feel each others' emotions, what are as usual as the breath or the beat of heart. I hope those LDR peoples could through the interaction design, precisely, by visual technic, to really feel each other's emotions' changes, and then, draw the distance more closer. 

Inputing the dates of breath (Control through changing the color or else), we transform those dates stream in a mobile phone interface, and make it become an airflow form's visual icons, and we can control it in a interaction way, which makes the interactive more interesting.  We want to collect the breathe of couples through by an app named M Here. For example,Ms.A and Mr.B are one distance couple. If they are partnership in the app. A can blow gently on the  working interface of the app on her mobile phone and she can see some moving image £¬which created by her blowing or her breathe. Although Mr.B is far away from Ms A.'HIs phone also will appear the same moving image which created by Ms.A's blowing or breath. It's a way to express although we are not in the same city or country, I am always at your side. I'm always here.
